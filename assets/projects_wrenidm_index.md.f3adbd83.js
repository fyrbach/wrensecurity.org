It can connect to and manage a wide range of systems through the Identity Connector Framework (Wren:ICF).</p><p>Wren:IDM is one of the projects in the Wren Security Suite, a community initiative that adopted open\u2010source projects formerly developed by ForgeRock, which has its own roots in Sun Microsystems\u2019 products.</p><p>Wren:IDM itself is focused on identity management processes and it also provides a powerful framework for implementing IAG and a portion of IAM processes as well. Although the project is based on OpenIDM code, it is not affiliated with ForgeRock in any way. It is based on the very latest code available under a CDDL license (not\u2010yet\u2010released OpenIDM 5.x).</p><p>The features of Wren:IDM include:</p><ul><li>A complete platform for building IDM and IG solutions using the concepts described below \u2013 roles, mappings, synchronizations, workflows, policies, etc.</li><li>ICF Connector Servers \u2013 services that allow connectors to be run outside of the IDM itself. Useful when a connector needs a specific client environment to talk to the integrated system. Also facilitates security. .NET and Java Connector Servers are available.</li><li>Administration GUI \u2013 an interface for making changes to data models and configuration using a point\u2010and\u2010click interface rather than Wren:IDM&#39;s REST interface.</li><li>Self\u2010service GUI \u2013 an interface for end\u2010users to update their profile information, passwords, and preferences.</li></ul><p>Both the Administration GUI and Self\u2010Service GUI are web\u2010based, single\u2010page applications that can be turned off in deployments that do not desire to use them <a href="#bibliogprahy">[1]</a>.</p><h2 id="acknowledgments" tabindex="-1">Acknowledgments <a class="header-anchor" href="#acknowledgments" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Large portions of the source code are based on the open-source projects previously released by:</p><ul><li>Sun Microsystems</li><li>ForgeRock</li></ul><p>We&#39;d like to thank them for supporting the idea of open-source software.</p><h2 id="disclaimer" tabindex="-1">Disclaimer <a class="header-anchor" href="#disclaimer" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Please note that the acknowledged parties are not affiliated with this project.
