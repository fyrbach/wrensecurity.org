The ideal person to help us is someone who\u2019s great at communicating, understands technical issues (without necessarily having to be a developer), and can spend about 10-15 hours a week helping us with content, posts, and discussions in the issue queue.</p></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">DevOps Admin</p><p>Someone to help us ensure that our buildable projects stay buildable, as we continue to accept PRs and enhancements. Experience with automated container creation and with integrating code style (e.g. FindBugs, CheckStyle, etc.) automatically in GitHub PRs is a plus. We expect that there will be more time needed up-front for this role than on-going; likely it will take the next few weeks to get us completely tuned up for this.</p></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Penetration Testers / Security Analysts</p><p>A lot of our current work involves fixing existing and/or known issues in projects like Wren:AM 13.5 and Wren:IDM 6. If you are someone who can help us find and plug the holes in our current releases, please reach out. We\u2019d love to tap your skill to make our platform even more secure.</p></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Project Leads</p><p>We\u2019re currently looking for leads for Wren:AM and Wren:DS to enhance our technical team. Leads would help coordinate PRs and enforce project process. Likely 15 to 20 hours per week; more if the leads want to have a more hands-on role in PRs.</p></div>',11),s=[r];function a(l,c,u,d,h,p){return o(),t("div",null,s)}var f=e(i,[["render",a]]);export{b as __pageData,f as default};
